The addresses listed below contain important values for those who want to make extraction scripts, parsers, or mods. These are also from observations but may not be exactly what I assumed they are. These are all mostly relevant to the CARS_.DAT files (which are what the RIDGE.EXE calls before extracting the TMD model files).

0x00 - 0x18 - all offsets to either data tables or padding

CAR.RSO seems to possibly be a shared construct between all of the cars. Its data follows the same structure as the some of the data tables linked above, so it may be a good source for figuring the full TMD file format structure used.

Data Tables that are probably a list of offsets to TMD OBJ TABLES:

0x00 - Length of the list in 4-byte sections with an offset of 0x04 (this first line doesn't count) - Math: value of this address * 4 + 0x04 + this value's address will take you to the end of the list
0x04 - end of list - the offset values; if these were the OBJ TABLEs, each chunk would have 7 4-byte values and the lists aren't of the right size for them

TMD header information hasn't been found yet but if Namco did start experimenting PSY-Q for this project, the version possibly could be a much older, experimental release.
