The data here is just from a quick look over some Playstation file format docs related to PSY-Q (which this game apparently didn't use but it looks like Namco was experimenting with it due to several file formats following its format docs and structure). I saw a reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/ridgeracer/comments/1h6k1f9/i_thought_it_would_be_easy_to_find_a_rip_of_ridge) asking about extracting the models and had a copy lying around, so I decided to check the game's files with a hex editor.
